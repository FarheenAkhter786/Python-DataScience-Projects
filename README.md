# Python DataScience Projects

This is a repository where all my projects related to data scince , data analytics , visualizations will reside. I will be updating it regularly!

## Projects

**Sentimental Analysis** 
- To Understand people's future reaction [[Link]](https://github.com/FarheenAkhter786/PythonDataScienceProjects/tree/main/Sentimental-Analysis)
- Use of SentimentIntensityAnalyzer to categorize in to Positive/Negative/Neutral Reaction
- **Keywords**(Pandas, DataAnalysis, Lexical Analysis, NLP)

**Movie Recommendation System** 
- Developed relationships by looking at the numbers representing how users have responded to the movie selections and users ratings, irrespective of its movie       name [[Link]](https://github.com/FarheenAkhter786/PythonDataScienceProjects/tree/main/Movie-RecommendationSystem)
- Applying  Collaborative Filtering Algorithm and then matrix factorization model for some embeddings
- Then Finally Kmeans clustering and determining the recomendations over movies
- **Keywords**(KMeans Clustering , Collaborative Filtering)

**Churn Detetection Model** 
- Losing customers is pretty common in the field of telecommuination and banking industry , So I built a model on telecomm dataset to analyze churn detection by considering various features
  [[Link]](https://github.com/FarheenAkhter786/PythonDataScienceProjects/tree/main/Churn-Detection-Model)
- Deep Data exploration and cleaning is performed
- Then Model is run on Keras Seruqnial to do predictions and genrate a classification report on accuracy , precision and recall!
- **Keywords**(Keras , Data Exploration, Data Mining)
